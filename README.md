## Introduction

### First Duo Project
For our first duo project David and I got the topic __Home__ together with the persona: __Alex__.
With this persona we went through the different iterations of Design Thinking to eventually come up with an app idea.
This app idea we then implemented in an iOS app (Swift).

Due to a time constraint David and I made a [Collaborative Assessment](https://github.com/Semester4Duo/Project-1/blob/main/README.md).

### Second Duo Project
For our second duo project David and I got the topic __Healthcare__ together with the persona's: __John__ and __Simon__.
With these persona's we went through the different iterations of Design Thinking to eventually come up with an app idea.
This app idea we then implemented in an Android app (Kotlin).

To get a better idea of how the process of project 2 went please go to the [Context document](https://github.com/Semester4Duo/Project-2/blob/main/Documentatie/Context.md)

##  Concepting
>You show you can convert a problem or opportunity into multiple smart mobile concepts based on thorough analysis.

Current Level (Level we think we achieved) : Beginning

For Concepting David and I worked together since most of the methods used are meant to be used in a team.

We used the following methods to concept:
- Empathy map
- Lotus flower
- Mind map
- POV
- How Might We
- 5 Why's

We used these methods because we thought at the time that these were the only methods applicable, however through the semester after receiving a lot of feedback David and I understood that the implementation of the Empathy map and Lotus Flower methods was not that accurate. However we have learned from this and now know better how to concept

### Deliverables

[Deliverables](https://github.com/KurzaCationer/Semester-4-Portfolio/blob/main/Deliverables.md#concepting)

## Design
>You translate concepts into user friendly designs and validate these designs through user tested iterations.

Current Level : Beginning

For design we made sure to try and tackle multiple things out of the UX Pillars to make sure our applications are as meaningful to the user as possible.

We made Empathy Maps in which we described how the user might feel when using our application and what areas need the most care. This gave us inspiration to make our application as clear as possible.

When making the application I came up with the idea to also see how our colors affect colorblind people and we came to the conclusion that our entire application stayed understandable.

David and I both worked on the design never really making something separate, However we both looked at other apps to make proper decisions on whether the design of the app is up to par.

Because we first came up with a Sleep App we have designs of that on the first Page

On the second and last page you can find the Designs and final Design of the app

## Hardware
>You employ relevant mobile hardware.

Current Level : Beginning

Initially because we came up with creating a sleep app, we both did a bit of research in how to use android and focused on a specific hardware feature that could be useful for a sleeping app. For that I made an app that could detect whether the phone has moved in a recent time and change the background color accordingly. This to demonstrate a simple sleep detector.

For the final app I made the video calling feature where the camera and mic are used to contact a GP. I made this feature with WebRTC which allows for peer to peer networking. Which means that the clients are transferring the video directly. Because of this the server has a minimal load.

## Professional Skills
>You demonstrate your professional development as a mobile developer in the form of authentic, professional IT tasks in which both the process and the result are visible.

Current Level : Proficient

I think the way I handle situations that arise is inline with that of a Professional, I don't really know how else to put it.
The way to make sure this learning outcome gets achieved is by acting Professionally through out the Semester


## Software
>You implement high quality applications using designs and programming languages on both (mobile) client and server side.

Current Level : Beginning

For Software David and I divided the features as good as possible this resulted in me making the following deliverables:

* Check-Up page
* Lifestyle Page
* Beginning of Home Page
* Initialization of project (Including bottom Tab Bar)
* Backend SignalR connection
